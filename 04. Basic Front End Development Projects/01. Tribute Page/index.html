          <p>Ayrton Cenna was a F1 racer that began his journey at the age of 3 using a kart that his father built using a lawn-mower engine.</p>
          <p>He started competing at the age of 13 and later went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977.</p>
          <p>In 1981, Senna moved to England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend-Thoreson Formula Ford 1600 Championships that year with the Van Diemen team. Despite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport.
            At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.</p>
